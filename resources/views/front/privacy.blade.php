            Your request for withdrawal of consent can take the form of an email or letter to us, or through the “Unsubscribe” feature in an online service.

            If you find that the personal data we hold about you is inaccurate, incomplete, misleading or not up-to-date you may ask us to correct the data. Where we are satisfied on reasonable grounds that a correction should be made, we will correct the data as soon as possible, or within 30 days from the date we receive your request.
        </p>

If this is not so, we will enter into a contractual agreement with the receiving party to accord similar levels of data protection as those in Singapore.
